                                Susana Eyhereamendy is Full Professor at the Faculty of 
                                Engineering and Sciences at the Adolfo Ibáñez University, 
                                she is Doctor of Statistics at Rutgers University, 
                                United States, 2004. She is an associate member 
                                of the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS) 
                                in charge of the astro-statistical group. Her research 
                                is based on the modeling, analysis and interpretation 
                                of large databases, especially in the areas of astronomy 
                                and genetics.

                                In this last field, his emphasis is on trying to 
                                understand the genetic basis of common diseases, 
                                using novel statistical methods. Recently, he has 
                                also paid special attention to the study of the population 
                                genetics of Chileans. He is currently studying the genetic 
                                basis of growth development and BMI in the children of 
                                the GOCS cohort. In the area of astro-statistics, she has worked, 
                                using machine learning techniques, on the classification of 
                                variable stars as well as other astronomical objects.

                                Susana is a member of the scientific committee of Alerce 
                                (web: alerce.science). The ALeRCE broker is a Chilean-led 
                                broker which is processing the alert stream from the 
                                Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and which aims to become 
                                a Community Broker for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and 
                                its Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), as well as 
                                other large etendue survey telescopes. We are using Cloud 
                                Infrastructure and Machine Learning models to bring 
                                real-time processed products and services to the astronomical 
                                community. Part of Susana's research in this area is dedicated 
                                to the development of models for irregularly observed time series, 
                                to be implemented in ALerce.
